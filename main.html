		<h2>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</h2>
	</header>

		<summary class="lh-lg fw-bold mt-3 mb-3 ml-4" >Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.</summary>

			<h4>Quotes</h4>
<p>Will Turner : Where's Elizabeth?<br>

Jack Sparrow : She's safe, just like I promised. She's all set to marry Norrington, just like she promised. And you get to die for her, just like you promised. So we're all men of our word really... except for, of course, Elizabeth, who is in fact, a woman.<br>

Jack Sparrow : This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!<br>

Will Turner : This is either madness... or brilliance.<br>

Jack Sparrow : It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.<br>

Mullroy : What's your purpose in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?<br>

Murtogg : Yeah, and no lies.<br>

Jack Sparrow : Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.<br>

Murtogg : I said no lies.<br>

Mullroy : I think he's telling the truth.<br>

Murtogg : If he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us.<br>

Jack Sparrow : Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth even if he told it to you.<br>

Norrington : No additional shot nor powder, a compass that doesn't point north,<br>
